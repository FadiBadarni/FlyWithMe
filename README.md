# FlyWithMe
Welcome to FlyWithMe, a flight booking system developed by a team of software engineering students as part of their introduction to networking course. We have utilized the latest technologies, including ASP.NET, C#, and a Firebase database, to create a seamless and intuitive website for our users.

## Enhancements to User Experience
To enhance the user experience, we have incorporated both CSS and JavaScript into our design. CSS allows us to define the styles and layout of the website, while JavaScript adds dynamic and interactive elements such as animations and drop-down menus. This combination results in a functional and visually appealing platform for our users.

## My Flight Page
One feature that we have implemented to improve the user experience is the "My Flight" page, which can be accessed from the navigation bar. This page allows users to enter their ID and confirmation number to view their reservation again. This is a convenient way for users to easily access their flight details.

## Advanced Search Functionality
In addition to standard search criteria such as departure and return dates, origin and destination countries, and number of passengers, our system also includes a sorting filter to help users find the best flights for their needs. Users can sort flights by price or popularity, and have the option to highlight the cheapest flight after search results are displayed. This helps users quickly and easily find flights that suit their budget and preferences.

## Security Measures
At FlyWithMe, we prioritize the safety and privacy of our users' personal and financial information. To protect against unauthorized access, we have implemented firewalls and utilize the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to encrypt sensitive data. We are dedicated to providing a secure platform for booking flights.

## Seat Reservation System
We have also implemented a seat reservation system to ensure that users can secure their seats until the flight is completed. This prevents any conflicts or double bookings and allows users to confidently book their flights without worrying about availability. This feature is particularly useful for users who may not have the time to complete the booking process in one sitting, as it allows them to come back later and pick up where they left off.

## Payment Options
To further improve the user experience, we offer multiple payment options. In addition to the use of the PayPal sandbox, which allows us to simulate real-life payments in a secure and controlled environment, we also offer the option to pay directly through our website. We understand the importance of convenience for our users, and we strive to make it as easy as possible for them to book their flights. However, we also prioritize the security of our users' payment information and do not store all of the payment information provided, only keeping a limited amount on file for future bookings.

## Run The Repo:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the command "git clone git@github.com:FadiBadarni/FlyWithMe.git" in your terminal.
2. Open the solution file "FlyWithMe.sln" in Visual Studio.
3. Install the PayPal API using the NuGet package installer in Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution by clicking on "Build" in the top menu and then "Build Solution" or press (Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. Run the website by clicking on "Debug" in the top menu and then "Start Without Debugging" or press (Ctrl+F5)
6. The website should now be running on a local server.
